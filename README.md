# Assignment 1: Action Game Clone

## [Here is what I have done so far (as of September 28th)] (https://ak5352.itch.io/freeway-clone-draft-3)
I created animated sprites, improved the collision system, and added delays after the player sprites collide with walls and cars. 

## [Here's what I had done by September 21st](https://ak5352.itch.io/freeway-clone-draft-2)
I created the cars/vehicles and gave them varying speeds and sizes as well as added a speed-based collision system that moves the players back depending on how hard they get hit by the cars.

## [Here's what I had done by September 15th](https://ak5352.itch.io/freeway-clone-draft-1)
I created the different scenes for the game, including ending scenes for each of the different outcomes (Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, tie), and I also implemented the time limit and scoring systems.
