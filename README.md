# Assignment 1: Action Game Clone

## [Here's what I've done so far (As of September 21)](https://ak5352.itch.io/freeway-clone-draft-2)
I created the cars/vehicles and gave them varying speeds and sizes as well as added a speed-based collision system that moves the players back depending on how hard they get hit by the cars.

## [Here's what I had done by September 15th](https://ak5352.itch.io/freeway-clone-draft-1)
I created the different scenes for the game, including ending scenes for each of the different outcomes (Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, tie), and I also implemented the time limit and scoring systems.
